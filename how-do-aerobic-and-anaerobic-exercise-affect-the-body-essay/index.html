<p>To evaluate the effect of aerobic and anaerobic endurance training the regulating the function of autonomic nervous system, in order to provide scientific basis for optimizing the project of physical fitness training. It substantially improves stamina, strengthens and tones muscles, helps prevent diseases, enhances flexibility, controls weight, and prolongs the quality of life. The aim of this assignment is to explore the impact of body exercise on the pulse rate in the human body. The underlying distinction between aerobic and anaerobic exercise is the use of oxygen for energy.</p>

<p>Your velocity increases and you become stronger because the anaerobic training increases your force and muscular mass. Energy comes from food which is converted into glucose and for the most efficient energy supply muscles also need oxygen. Most of our cells prefer to get their energy by using oxygen to fuel metabolism. In relation to the anatomy and physiology of the circulatory system, when an individual undertakes a strenuous exercise, more energy is demanded than can be provided by aerobic respiration since oxygen cannot be obtained rapidly enough.
