<p>In short, positive pressure ventilation affects preload, afterload and ventricular compliance, and the effect in most situations is a decrease in cardiac output. As heart rate increases, so does cardiac output. For a given tpr, the blood pressure is maintained unless there is a relative bradycardia or a further fall in stroke volume.

That is, the volume of blood being pumped by both ventricles of the heart, per unit time (usually measured per minute). Hence any factor, which affects either the heart rate, or stroke volume, or both will alter the cardiac output. Pin on Chapter 19 The Heart.</p>

<p>For a given tpr, the blood pressure is maintained unless there is a relative bradycardia or a further fall in stroke volume. Cardiac output is made up of two components. However, with increased heart rate there is decreased time for ventricular filling, so stroke volume decreases and cardiac outpu. The stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out by each ventricle per beat or per contraction. Cardiac Output Cardiac, Respiratory care, Cognative behavioral therapy.</p>
